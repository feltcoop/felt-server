# Personal Community

Felt has a special kind of `Community` object called a **personal community**.
It's a bit of a misnomer; it's more of a personal workspace than a community,
but it inherits most of the qualities of the normal Felt community,
with some important differences:

- a personal community is created automatically for every persona
- a personal community has the same `name` as its persona
- a personal community's membership includes its owning persona,
  and **no other personas may be invited as members**,
  including other personas under the same account

## questions

- can resources be shared outside of the community's membrane?
  - publishing usecase: e.g. a blog or a public poll
  - what about spaces?
  - what is the UX like? do personas get a list of all of the resources they can access?
- what should the default spaces be?
- how else are they distinct?
