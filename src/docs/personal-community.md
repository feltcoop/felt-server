# Personal Community

Felt has a special kind of `Community` object called a **personal community**.
It's a bit of a misnomer; it's more of a personal workspace than a community,
but it inherits most of the qualities of the normal Felt community,
with some important differences:

- a personal community is created automatically for every persona
- a personal community has the same `name` as its persona
- instead of a "home" view at the root space, they have a "profile" view,
  with a set of widgets designed for single-player usage
- a personal community's membership includes its owning persona,
  and **no other personas may be invited as members**,
  including other personas under the same account
