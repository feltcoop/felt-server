Thanks for your interest in contributing! Before you get started you'll need to get your local machine set up.

## Getting Started

1. Configure your environment to the Node & NPM versions listed in [package.json](/package.json)
1. Run `npm i`
1. Install [Gro](https://github.com/feltcoop/gro)
   globally to [run tasks](https://github.com/feltcoop/gro/tree/main/src/task#readme):
   `npm i -g @feltcoop/gro`
1. [Install Postgresql](/src/lib/db/README.md)
1. Run `gro lib/db/create` to initialize the database'
1. Run [`gro dev`](https://github.com/feltcoop/gro/blob/main/src/docs/dev.md)
   and navigate to localhost:3000 to start!

## Developing

In most cases [`gro dev`](https://github.com/feltcoop/gro/blob/main/src/docs/dev.md)
is the only command you'll need to run during development.
It starts both SvelteKit and an API server,
and when files change they should update or restart automatically.

There's two manual steps that you may sometimes need to perform:

## `gro format`

Gro integrates formatting with [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier).
[This project's CI](/.github/workflows/check.yml)
runs `gro check` which runs `gro format --check` which fails if any files are unformatted.
You can manually format the project with `gro format`, and if you're using VSCode,
[the Prettier extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
combined with the setting `"editor.formatOnSave": true`
should take care of formatting automatically.

## `gro gen`

Gro provides the [`gro gen`](https://github.com/feltcoop/gro/blob/main/src/docs/gen.md)
task to make it easier to derive data and other files from single sources of truth.
It currently has a limitation where it does not run automatically;
the developer is expected to run `gro gen` when things change.
Making this process automatic is next on
[`gro gen`'s TODO list](https://github.com/feltcoop/gro/blob/main/src/docs/gen.md#todo),
but it's a tricky system to design without surprising performance implications.

[This project's CI](/.github/workflows/check.yml)
runs `gro check` which runs `gro gen --check` which fails if any generated files have changed,
to help ensure that the committed files remain in sync.

> The files that `gro gen` outputs are formatted automatically when possible,
> so there's no need to get things perfect.
